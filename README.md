# CORE VERTICAL — Structural & Infrastructure Systems

This repository defines the Structural & Infrastructure vertical for CORE.

It is a **solid-mechanics-centric system** for analyzing resonance,
stress, and failure conditions in built environments.

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

- KINETIC — stress, strain, vibration
- ARES — acoustic amplification
- THERMOS — thermal expansion
- LITHOS — material composition
- SIGNAL — anomaly detection
- RGSR — fusion

## Real-World Phenomena Modeled

- Building resonance
- Bridge vibration
- Infrastructure fatigue
- Collapse precursors
- Load transfer & amplification

## What This Vertical Is

- A **structural risk analysis platform**
- A **resonance and safety interpretation system**

## What This Vertical Is Not

- Not an engineering sign-off
- Not a construction controller
- Not regulatory certification

## Registries & Lenses

- Structure archetypes
- Material libraries
- Load scenario profiles

## Governance

All outputs are advisory and non-certifying.
